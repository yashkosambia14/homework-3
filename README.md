# Homework-3
# Assignmnet due October 1
#Instructions:

- If you are a student who is registered to this class, click on the link that I shared with you. That will create a private Github repository for you. Once you have that repository, clone it to your local by using "git clone".

- Go to src/mypkg then modify the file "my_answers.py". You should be able to run this file as you are editing it but tests will not be run yet.

- In order to run the tests, make sure you have pytest installed in your environment. Simply type "pip install pytest".

- To build your program, type "python setup.py install".

- In your terminal, cd to homework-3 and type "pytest". It should run all the tests for this assignment and you should be able to see the output.

- If you are a student registered to this class, you can commit your changes and push your code to your private Github repository. Travis-CI will run the tests you ran in your local in the cloud.
